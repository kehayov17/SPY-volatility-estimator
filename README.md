# SPY-volatility-estimator
This is a project for estimating SPY future volatility using 2 different methods.


## The first method is using EGARCH.You can set start and end dates for the historical data , but keep in mind that for garch models atleast 1000 data points are needed for a good fit(in this case meaning atleast a 1000 days of historical data).
